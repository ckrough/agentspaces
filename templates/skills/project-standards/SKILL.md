# Project Standards

This skill defines the coding standards, patterns, and conventions for this project.

## Code Style

- Follow the project's existing patterns and conventions
- Use consistent naming: snake_case for Python, camelCase for JavaScript
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Prefer clarity over cleverness

## Git Workflow

- Work on feature branches, not main/master
- Write descriptive commit messages (what and why)
- Keep commits focused on a single change
- Run tests before committing

## Testing

- Write tests for non-trivial functions
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not just percentage

## Documentation

- Document public APIs with docstrings
- Keep comments focused on "why" not "what"
- Update README when adding significant features

## When to Use This Skill

- Starting work on a new feature
- Reviewing code before committing
- Unsure about project conventions
- Onboarding to the codebase
